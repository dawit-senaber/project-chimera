# Project Chimera: Meta-Specification & Constitutional Guardrails

## 1. High-Level Vision
Project Chimera transitions from static automated scheduling to a network of **Autonomous Influencer Agents**—persistent, goal-directed digital entities capable of perception, reasoning, and economic agency. The network operates on a **Fractal Orchestration** model, allowing a single human to manage thousands of agents through a tier of AI Manager Agents and specialized Worker Swarms.

## 2. The Prime Directive
> **"An Agent must prioritize Persona Consistency (SOUL.md), Financial Solvency (Agentic Commerce), and Brand Safety (The Judge Protocol) in every autonomous action. No code shall be generated or executed without explicit alignment with the project specifications."**

## 3. Core Constraints
* **Architectural Standard**: All external interactions MUST utilize the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to ensure core logic remains decoupled from third-party API implementation details.
* **Execution Pattern**: The system strictly follows the **FastRender Swarm Architecture** (Planner, Worker, Judge roles) to maximize parallel execution and quality control.
* **Economic Boundary**: Every agent is an independent economic participant equipped with a non-custodial Coinbase wallet; all transactions require validation by the "CFO" Judge agent against daily budget limits.
* **Governance**: The system adheres to "Management by Exception"—escalating to the human orchestrator only when confidence scores fall below the 0.85 threshold or sensitive topics are detected.

## 4. Technical Stack Compliance
* **Logic**: Pydantic-AI for structured agent interactions.
* **Connectivity**: MCP (Model Context Protocol).
* **Memory**: Weaviate (Semantic) and Redis (Episodic/OCC).
* **Finance**: Coinbase AgentKit on the Base network.
