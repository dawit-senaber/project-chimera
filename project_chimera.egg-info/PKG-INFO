# 🦁 Project Chimera
**Autonomous Influencer Factory | Ethiopian Market Focus**

---

## 🎯 Overview
Project Chimera is an advanced agentic ecosystem built on **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**. It automates the lifecycle of a digital influencer—from trend discovery to on-chain settlement—using a strictly governed, containerized architecture.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture
| Component | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Pattern** | Sequential Chain (Discovery → Generation → Settlement) |
| **Governance** | Automated AI Policy via `CodeRabbit` |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose + GitHub Actions (CI/CD) |
| **Development** | Test-Driven Development (TDD) with `pytest` |

---

## 🚀 Technical Quick Start
Ensure you have **Docker** and **uv** installed.

```bash
# Execute the full validation suite (Builds container & runs tests)
docker compose up --build --exit-code-from agent-chimera


📂 Repository Roadmap

📜 specs/ - Technical contracts and JSON schemas (Source of Truth).

⚡ skills/ - Modular agent capabilities (Trend Fetching, Media Gen, Payments).

🧪 tests/ - Automated validation suite ensuring spec alignment.

🤖 .cursor/rules/ - Agentic "Brain Rules" for IDE orchestration.

🛡️ .coderabbit.yaml - Automated AI governance and security audit policy.

⚖️ Governance & Safety Layer
Human-in-the-Loop: A mandatory PENDING_REVIEW database state prevents unauthorized posts.

Security Audits: Automated checks for unvalidated addresses and leaked credentials.

Spec Fidelity: All logic is mapped directly to technical.md contracts.

### Failing Tests & TDD Story

We follow a TDD-first approach for key governance features. The repository
intentionally includes a failing spec that protects the project's finances:

- `tests/test_cfo_governance.py` — asserts that payments exceeding the
	environment-configured `DAILY_SPEND_LIMIT_USDC` are blocked by a budget guard.

This failing test defines an "empty slot" that demonstrates how agents must
implement critical guardrails before code is accepted. See `tests/` for details.

Created for the Chimera Orchestrator Mission - February 2026
